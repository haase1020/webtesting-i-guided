# Testing

## Objectives

- setup testing from scratch.
- write unit tests.
- Test Driven Development.

AAA = Arrange -> Act -> Assert

function(args) => return value; To test it we invoke a function.

Component(props) => return UI; To test it we render a component.

Endpoint(data) => return HTTP response; To test it we make a request.

Test suite: a group of tests in the same file.

> make sure your test can fail.

## User Stories

As a ... role
I want ... feature
So that ... value

As an analyst
I want a calculator that can add two numbers
So that I can write the sales reports

### Scenarios

```txt
Given ...
  and ...
  and ...
When ...
  and ...
  and ...
Then ...
  and ...
```

Given two numbers
When the add function is invoked
Then it should return the sum of the two numbers

## Test Driven Development/Design

Red > Green > Refactor --------> Commit

Red: write a failing test.

Green: write enough implementation code to make the test pass.

Refactor: rewrite the code without changing the functionality. Reformatting the test and implementation code without breaking the tests.

## What to test

- start with low hanging fruit --> happy path (your basic assumptions)
- then check for invalid input
- then move on to edge cases
